MonkeyTool
-----------

MonkeyTool is a text-based Linux distribution made for system recovery. It may
be booted for example from an optical drive or a USB device.

MonkeyTool is based on Arch Linux and it must be built on an Arch Linux system.
If you are not running one, you could build MonkeyTool in a virtual machine.

The scripts for building MonkeyTool are licensed under the ISC license. Please
note that the software that will be packed into the image is under the copyright
of it's respectful copyright holders.

Arch Linux packages needed for building:
	base base-devel archiso-git

To create the image use the following command:
	make

It will ask for the root password with sudo for certain operations. You should
not run "make" directly as root.

You can customize the package list by editing packages.list. The lines starting
with an asterisk (*) are fetched from AUR.

After you have created both the 32-bit image and the 64-bit you can combine them
to a hybrid image. With it you can choose the architecture on the boot menu.
Note that the hybrid image is about twice as big.

Create a hybrid image:
	./createhybrid.sh MonkeyTool-git-i686.iso MonkeyTool-git-x86_64.iso

The image can be burned in to a CD or a USB device using utilities like
dd.
